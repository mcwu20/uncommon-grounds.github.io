	<h2>We Serve Only Fair Trade Coffee</h2>
    <p>A number of community-based programs in coffee-growing countries directly benefit from the purchase of our coffee. For example, farmers in Peru and Mexico receive a higher price per pound for their coffee (above and beyond the going rate for certified coffee) to help support local domestic violence intervention programs and small business loans for women.
